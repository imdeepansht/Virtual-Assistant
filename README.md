# Virtual-Assistant
Ever wondered how Alexa, Google Home, Siri, Cortana etc. are made? Python is the answer.
This is a very basic version. Making it is very easy! 
This can send mails, tell the time and many more things which you can discover.

For making this, you will need import some modules
Just open your CMD/Windows Powershell type these:-
pip install pyttsx3,

pip install speechRecognition,

pip install wikipedia

Other modules could already be installed in your computer and if they're not, you always have the internet.
You can make changes in the code according to your needs and upgrade your own Virtual Assistant.

Thank You!

Hope You will enjoy it!
