# Virtual-Assistant
Ever wondered how Alexa, Google Home, Siri, Cortana etc. are made? Python is the answer. I will give you the code.
Yes, this is not so much advanced, but a basic one which I have made.

This can send mails, tell the time and many more things which you can discover.

For making this, you will need import some modules
Just open your CMD and install these modules
pip install pyttsx3
pip install speechRecognition
pip install wikipedia
Other modules could already be installed in your computer and if they're not, you always have the internet.

You can make changes in the code and make your own Virtual Assistant
